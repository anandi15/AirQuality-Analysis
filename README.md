### **Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard | Power BI Environmental Analytics Project**  
*Self-directed project | 2025*  
- Designed and developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize and monitor **air quality metrics** across major Indian cities using real-world pollutant data (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, SO₂, NH₃, O₃).  
- Leveraged **Power Query** to connect to and transform data from SharePoint, performing data cleaning tasks including null value handling and column filtering.  
- Created **dynamic visualizations** including line charts (AQI trends), bar charts (city-wise comparisons), map visuals (pollution hotspots), and KPI cards (key pollutant levels).  
- Implemented **slicers and filters** for user-driven analysis by location and time period, enhancing interactivity and data exploration.  
- Promoted awareness of environmental health issues while strengthening Power BI proficiency in data modeling, DAX, and report design.
